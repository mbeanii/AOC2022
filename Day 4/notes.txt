Part One:
Each input line may be described as a:

set of two sets of numbers.
The inner sets are separated by dashes.
The outer sets are separated by commas.

What we want is the number of times one set fully
contains the other.

That could mean the first set fully contains the second
Or the second fully contains the first.

One approach would be to enumerate both sets
and do a X & Y and see if the result is the same length
as either X or Y

But simpler will be:

One set fully encorporates the other if the first
number of one is greater than or equal to the first
number of the other AND the second number of the
first is less than or equal to the second number
of the second.
I'm ready to start coding.

K that's wrong above. It's actually one encorporates
the other IFF both the first and second of one fall
between (inclusive) the first and second of the other.

My logic for this isn't working and I'm tired of it.
I'm going to try the set approach.
After resolving an off by 1 issue with the range function, I got that working :)

Part 2:
Easy here - it's just the same only the check is to see if the intersection is not 0.
