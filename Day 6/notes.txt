Part One:
start-of-packet marker
Detect four characters that are all different

Identify the first position where the four most recently received characters were all different

(The number of characters from the beginning of the buffer to the end of the first such four-character marker)

could use a sliding window
throw it into a set
if len(set) == len(window) - done
otherwise, inc the window

I think this should be pretty easy.
